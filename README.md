# K-Medoids-algo-without-Library
 The program will take two inputs: a data file containing multiple continuous features and a value for k. Your program will load the data file, calculate the dissimilarity matrix and then apply the k-medoids algorithm. The clustering process will continue until cluster assignments do not change or maximum 100 iterations have been completed. The program will also calculate average silhouette width for the final clustering solution. The program will add a new column containing cluster ids (1, 2, 3, â€¦, k) to the original input file and save it to clusters_k.csv, where k is the number of clusters. The program will also show the average silhouette width in the console.
